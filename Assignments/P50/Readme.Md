## Leet:50 -  Pow(x,n)
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

Approach: Similar to the square root problem. Leet code doesnt block you from using the built in pow() function but I ended using a mathematical approach to solving this problem using a single formula and accounting for when the base is negative and also accounting for the signs of the exponent which makes the result change sign based on if it is even or negative.
