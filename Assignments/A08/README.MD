## Leet:797 - All Paths From Source to Target 
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).

Approach: Used a Dept first search to look at every possible patch between two nodes.
