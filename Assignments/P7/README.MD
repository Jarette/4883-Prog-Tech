## Leet:7 - Reverse Integer
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Approach: Brute force solution that reuses solutions for previously solved leet problem and then performing checks for size.
