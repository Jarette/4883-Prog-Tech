## 10055 - Hashmat the brave warrior
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to
fight against his opponents. Before Fighting he just calculates one thing, the difference between his
soldier number and the opponent’s soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or
not. Hashmat’s soldier number is never greater than his opponent. This projects accepts series of values
where each line contains two values so the program find the difference between the values ensuring no 
negative numbers and displays result each on unique lines.
