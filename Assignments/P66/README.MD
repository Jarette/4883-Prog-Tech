### Description:

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Approach: Removes all 9 off the end of the value until empty or approaching value < 9 then adding 1 to the list empty or adding 1 to the back value. Then fill the rest of the vector with 0s
