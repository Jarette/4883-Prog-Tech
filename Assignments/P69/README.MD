## Leet: 69 -  Sqrt(x)
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

Approach: Originally used C++'s sqrt(x) built in function but that is cheating so found mathematical implementation of sqrt
