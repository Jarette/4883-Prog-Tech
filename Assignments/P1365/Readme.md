## Leet:1365 -  How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
### Jarette Greene
### Description:

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Approach: Brute Force solution where for each element in the vector was checked against every other memebers and incrementing each individual element's less than count in a new vector.
